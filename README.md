# MARS
### What is this?
MARS is a Unity project to be submitted for the Introduction to Unity course, summer semester of 2023. 
It is (rather, should be) a tower-defense like video game.
### (planned) Features:
  - Enemies spawn in increasingly difficult waves
  - The player can place turrets that engage those enemies automatically
  - These turrets can be upgraded
  - There should be health bars 
  
### optional, additional Features:
  - different Turret types
  - different Enemy types
  - larger (boss-like) enemies

### Art and such
There should be a scifi-looking UI and textures. Details and planned features might be added here once I have a running version of the game.
